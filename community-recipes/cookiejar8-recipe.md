Sweet & Smoky Caramelized Red Onions

Instructions

- Warm the Pan Slowly: Heat oil and butter in a large, heavy skillet over medium-low heat.
- Season from the Start: Add onions, salt, pepper, chili flakes, paprika, garlic powder, and thyme if using. Toss well.
- Low & Slow Cooking: Cook 25–35 minutes. Stir occasionally at first, then more often as onions soften and darken. Lower heat if they brown too fast.
- Deglaze if Needed: If a crust forms, add 1 tbsp water to loosen and stir up the flavor.
- Finish: Once onions are deep brown and jammy, stir in honey (or maple/brown sugar) and balsamic vinegar. Cook 2–3 minutes until glossy.
- Serve or Store: Enjoy right away, or refrigerate up to 5 days.
